title: Weekly Summary

Formal coding period hasn't officialy started, so my progress is a little slow. I have been reading a couple of books and articles to hopefully improve the quality of my code. I set up a twitter profile [@notjordi5](https://twitter.com/notjordi5), in case that's the way the mentors want to log our progress, and a DevLog to add dayly entries.
I helped with a couple of issues and introduced issues to the code with my PRs by being careless with a branch. Let's hope that it is fixed quickly. I have finally understood how to work on branches properly, so I don't expect to make the same mistake. Next week I'll start dedicating many more hours to my work.

On a non coding note I have been talking with some members of the project and they all seem cool and fun.
