title: First Official week in TARDIS
---
I'm officially coding for TARDIS, this first week has been fun but also a bit daunting. We started discussing the direction that they want the model to go and agree on some design for now. Writting code this way more difficult than I previously though, not being that familiar with working in a large project. Also realizing that there are so many things that I don't know.
