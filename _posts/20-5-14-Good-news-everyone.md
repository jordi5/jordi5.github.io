I've been accepted at de Google Summer of Code and will be working in the [TARDIS](http://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/) project. I have met the community and my mentors and they all seem nice. We will start working soon, you can check my proposal [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4992217086689280). It's very exciting.
