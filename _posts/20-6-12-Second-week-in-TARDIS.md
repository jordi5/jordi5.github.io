title: Second Week in TARDIS 
---
During the second week I'm getting more work done, althogh my progress is still a little slow. I was, and still am, a bit worried about this but during the weekly meeting mentors have been helpful and really supportive and I can't thank them enough for that.
I've realized that my workflow is a little bit disorganized so I'm trying to remedy that. Some practices I still can't get in my head, like share my code more often, but there are so many ways to do things that I can't choose one!
The model is slowly taking shape, but this could be restarted at any moment, so stay tuned.
